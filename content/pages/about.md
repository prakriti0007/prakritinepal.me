## Namaste and hello! 
I’m Prakriti Nepal—yes, Nepal! And, fun fact, I’m actually from the country called Nepal. Imagine being named London and actually being from the UK! My country’s known for the Gorkhalis, brave warriors with an unbreakable spirit. I like to think I bring a bit of that courage and determination to everything I do, especially when it comes to helping others.
I’m a sophomore here at William Paterson University of New Jersey, double-majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. During the day, I’m coding and crunching numbers, and by night… Well, it’s mostly the same, but with extra snacks! 
I’m always eager to share my culture. Whether it’s introducing you to Nepali tea or teaching a few words in Nepali, I’d love to share a piece of home with all of you! I know being in a new place can sometimes feel overwhelming, especially if English isn’t your first language. I’m more than happy to adjust, to learn together, and to help everyone feel included. I believe we’re all in this together, and my goal is to make earth a place where everyone feels they belong.
So, here’s to an incredible year ahead!
